# fashion_classification
This project demonstrates a simple deep learning model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.
Agenda:
1.Libraries
2.Load Data
3.Show image from Numbers.
4.Buil First Neural Network.
5.Train Model
6.Test and Evaluate.
7.Confusion matrix
8.Classification Report 
9.Save Model.
How it will work.
At the input layer we will give our product ,hidden layer process on the input and give output.
input layer(shoes)----->hidden layer------>output layer(Shoes)
#Project Overview
Dataset: Fashion MNIST
(60,000 training images + 10,000 testing images â€” 28x28 grayscale clothing items)
Goal:
Train a model to recognize clothing categories such as T-shirt, Trouser, Sneaker, etc.
Libraries Used:
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
scikit-learn (for evaluation)
Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
Steps Performed
Import Libraries

#Load Data

Loaded Fashion MNIST dataset using:
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()
Preprocessing
Normalized pixel values (optional).
Reshaped data if necessary for model input.
Model Building
Created a simple Neural Network (Dense layers or CNN depending on notebook content).
Model Training
Trained the model on x_train and y_train.
Prediction
Predicted labels for test set (x_test).
Used np.argmax() to extract the predicted class.
Evaluation
Generated a confusion matrix using:
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, [np.argmax(i) for i in y_pred])
Visualization (optional)
Displayed example predictions.
Optionally plotted the confusion matrix.

Class Labels

Label	Class
0	T-shirt/top
1	Trouser
2	Pullover
3	Dress
4	Coat
5	Sandal
6	Shirt
7	Sneaker
8	Bag
9	Ankle boot

F#uture Improvements
Try using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for better accuracy.
Visualize the confusion matrix using a heatmap.
Perform data augmentation to improve model generalization.
